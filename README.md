# [dndsheet](alxjnr.github.io/dndsheet)

This web app was made using JS and DOM manipulation. Users are able to generate a first and last name, a race and a class for their DND characters. 
<br>
<br>
The names are generated using arrays of consonants and vowels. Consonants are added first to an empty array, followed by a vowel and so on, creating names of random lengths. Consonant and vowel arrays are weighted towards certain characters depending on the race selected.

## Known Issues

- CSS is currently not mobile-friendly.
